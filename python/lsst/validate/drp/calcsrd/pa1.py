class PA1Measurement(MeasurementBase):
    """Measurement of the PA1 metric: photometric repeatability of
    measurements across a set of observations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    matchedDataset : lsst.validate.drp.matchreduce.MatchedMultiVisitDataset
    bandpass : str
        Bandpass (filter name) used in this measurement (e.g., `'r'`)
    numRandomShuffles : int
        Number of times to draw random pairs from the different observations.
    verbose : bool, optional
        Output additional information on the analysis steps.
    job : :class:`lsst.validate.drp.base.Job`, optional
        If provided, the measurement will register itself with the Job
        object.
    linkedBlobs : list, optional
        A `list` of additional blobs (subclasses of BlobSerializerBase) that
        can provide additional context to the measurement, though aren't
        direct dependencies of the computation (e.g., `matchedDataset).

    Attributes
    ----------
    rms : ndarray
        Photometric repeatability RMS of stellar pairs for each random
        sampling.
    iqr : ndarray
       Photometric repeatability IQR of stellar pairs for each random sample.
    magDiff : ndarray
        Magnitude differences of stars between visits, for each random sample.
    magMean : ndarray
        Mean magnitude of stars seen across visits, for each random sample.
    blob : PA1Blob
        Blob with by-products from this measurement.

    Notes
    -----
    We calculate differences for 50 different random realizations of the
    measurement pairs, to provide some estimate of the uncertainty on our RMS
    estimates due to the random shuffling.  This estimate could be stated and
    calculated from a more formally derived motivation but in practice 50
    should be sufficient.

    The LSST Science Requirements Document (LPM-17), or SRD, characterizes the
    photometric repeatability by putting a requirement on the median RMS of
    measurements of non-variable bright stars.  This quantity is PA1, with a
    design, minimum, and stretch goals of (5, 8, 3) millimag following LPM-17
    as of 2011-07-06, available at http://ls.st/LPM-17.

    This present routine calculates this quantity in two different ways:

    1. RMS
    2. interquartile range (IQR)

    and also returns additional quantities of interest:

    - the pair differences of observations of stars,
    - the mean magnitude of each star

    While the SRD specifies that we should just compute the RMS directly, the
    current filter doesn't screen out variable stars as carefully as the SRD
    specifies, so using a more robust estimator like the IQR allows us to
    reject some outliers.  However, the IRQ is also less sensitive some
    realistic sources of scatter such as bad zero points, that the metric
    should include.
