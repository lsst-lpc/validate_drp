class PF1Measurement(MeasurementBase):
    """Measurement of PF1: fraction of samples between median RMS (PA1) and
    PA2 specification.

    Parameters
    ----------
    matchedDataset : lsst.validate.drp.matchreduce.MatchedMultiVisitDataset
    bandpass : str
        Bandpass (filter name) used in this measurement (e.g., `'r'`).
    specName : str
        Name of a specification level to measure against (e.g., design,
        minimum, stretch).
    verbose : bool, optional
        Output additional information on the analysis steps.
    job : :class:`lsst.validate.drp.base.Job`, optional
        If provided, the measurement will register itself with the Job
        object.
    linkedBlobs : list, optional
        A `list` of additional blobs (subclasses of BlobSerializerBase) that
        can provide additional context to the measurement, though aren't
        direct dependencies of the computation (e.g., `matchedDataset).

    Notes
    -----
    The LSST Science Requirements Document (LPM-17) is commonly referred
    to as the SRD.  The SRD puts a limit that no more than PF1 % of difference
    will vary by more than PA2 millimag.  The design, minimum, and stretch
    goals are PF1 = (10, 20, 5) % at PA2 = (15, 15, 10) millimag following
    LPM-17 as of 2011-07-06, available at http://ls.st/LPM-17.
